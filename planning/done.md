# MoneyWarp - Completed Tasks Archive

## Project Initialization (2025-09-12)

### Setup & Planning
- [DONE] ✅ Read and understand project development rules
- [DONE] ✅ Analyze current project structure  
- [DONE] ✅ Define MoneyWarp project vision and scope
- [DONE] ✅ Create planning directory structure (`planning/general.md`, `planning/backlog.md`, `planning/done.md`)
- [DONE] ✅ Document initial project plan

### Key Achievements:
1. **Project Vision Defined**: MoneyWarp as a time value of money library with intuitive "time-warping" approach
2. **Development Framework**: Established planning workflow following project rules
3. **Reference Analysis**: Identified loan-calculator as foundation for financial calculations
4. **Task Organization**: Created structured planning system for tracking progress

## Core Architecture Design (2025-09-12)

### Architectural Models Completed
- [DONE] ✅ **CashFlow Architecture**: Designed as container with CashFlowItems for individual transactions
- [DONE] ✅ **Loan Model**: State machine approach generating cash flows on demand (expected/actual/remaining)
- [DONE] ✅ **Flexible Scheduling**: Replaced rigid payment frequencies with `due_dates: List[Date]`
- [DONE] ✅ **InterestRate Safety**: Designed robust InterestRate class with explicit decimal/percentage handling
- [DONE] ✅ **Focus Definition**: Narrowed scope to personal loan analysis as primary use case

### Design Decisions:
1. **CashFlow = Container + CashFlowItems**: Clear separation between stream and individual transactions
2. **Loan as State Machine**: Generates cash flows dynamically rather than storing multiple versions
3. **Due Dates Flexibility**: Supports irregular schedules, seasonal payments, custom arrangements
4. **Interest Rate Clarity**: Eliminates 0.05 vs 5% confusion with explicit creation methods
5. **Money Precision**: High internal precision, 2-decimal "real money" representation
6. **Schedule Generation**: 3 items per payment (total + interest + principal), daily compounding, includes disbursement
