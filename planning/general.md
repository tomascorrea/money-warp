## Project Definition & Initial Setup

## Architectural Decisions Summary

### Core Models Design
1. **Money Class**: High internal precision, 2-decimal "real money" representation
2. **CashFlow Structure**: Container with CashFlowItems for individual transactions
3. **Loan Model**: State machine generating cash flows on demand (expected/actual/remaining)
4. **Flexible Scheduling**: `due_dates: List[Date]` instead of rigid payment frequencies
5. **InterestRate Safety**: Explicit decimal/percentage handling with conversion methods
6. **Schedule Generation**: 3 items per payment (total + interest + principal breakdown)
7. **Interest Calculation**: Daily compounding based on exact days between payments
8. **Payment Strategy**: Fixed payment amounts for irregular schedules (initial approach)
9. **Disbursement Handling**: Automatically included in generated schedules
