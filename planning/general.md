# MoneyWarp - Current Active Tasks

## Current Status

**Latest Achievement:** ✅ **Time Machine (Warp) Implementation Complete!**

Successfully implemented the Time Machine feature with elegant time-aware architecture. Key accomplishments:

- **Core Philosophy**: *"The loan is always time sensitive... it always filters based on present date regardless if it is warped or not... the warp just changes the present date."*
- **Clean API**: Simple context manager `with Warp(loan, '2030-01-15') as warped_loan:`
- **Time-Aware Loans**: Loans automatically filter payments and calculate balance based on current time
- **Safe Architecture**: Uses cloning and `WarpedTime` class instead of mocks or global state
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 271 total tests passing, including 17 new Warp tests
- **Elegant Implementation**: Just 3 lines of core logic in `_apply_time_warp()`

**Key Features:**
- 🕰️ **Natural time filtering**: Loans show state as of any date automatically
- 🔄 **Safe cloning**: Original loan never modified during time travel  
- 📅 **Flexible dates**: Accepts strings, datetime, or date objects
- 🚫 **No nested warps**: Prevents dangerous time paradoxes
- ⚡ **Instant calculations**: Balance and payment history update automatically

## Project Definition & Initial Setup

## Architectural Decisions Summary

### Core Models Design
1. **Money Class**: High internal precision, 2-decimal "real money" representation
2. **CashFlow Structure**: Container with CashFlowItems for individual transactions
3. **Loan Model**: State machine generating cash flows on demand (expected/actual/remaining)
4. **Flexible Scheduling**: `due_dates: List[Date]` instead of rigid payment frequencies
5. **InterestRate Safety**: Explicit decimal/percentage handling with conversion methods
6. **Schedule Generation**: 3 items per payment (total + interest + principal breakdown)
7. **Interest Calculation**: Daily compounding based on exact days between payments
8. **Payment Strategy**: Fixed payment amounts for irregular schedules (initial approach)
9. **Disbursement Handling**: Automatically included in generated schedules

### Task Group 1: Environment Setup & Core Implementation (IN PROGRESS)
**Goal**: Set up development environment and implement core classes

#### Environment Setup

#### Documentation & Polish
- [ ] Update README with MoneyWarp description and examples
- [ ] Add docstrings to all public methods
- [ ] Create usage examples for each core class
- [ ] Document architectural decisions

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Architecture Approach**: Will build upon loan-calculator concepts but with a more intuitive "time-warping" metaphor
2. **Core Focus**: Personal loan analysis with emphasis on cash flow modeling
3. **Development Strategy**: Start with core models (CashFlow, Loan, InterestRate), then build TimeMachine

### Architectural Decisions Completed:
1. **CashFlow Model**: Container with CashFlowItems (individual transactions)
2. **Loan Structure**: State machine that generates cash flows on demand (expected, actual, remaining)
3. **Flexible Scheduling**: Use `due_dates: List[Date]` instead of rigid payment frequencies
4. **Interest Rate Safety**: Dedicated `InterestRate` class with explicit decimal/percentage handling

### Next Priority Tasks:
