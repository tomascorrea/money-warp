MoneyWarp is a Python library for working with the time value of money. It treats loans, annuities, and investments as simple cash flows through time — and gives you the tools to warp them back and forth between present, future, and everything in between.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🕰️ **Time Machine (Warp)** - Travel to any date and see loan state as of that moment
- 🔢 **Calculate PMT, NPV, IRR, MIRR** and other core finance functions with scipy
- ⏳ **Track loans and repayments** as evolving cash-flow streams  
- 🌀 **Explore "what if" timelines** by bending payments across time
- 💰 **High-precision calculations** using Decimal arithmetic
- 📊 **Progressive Price Schedules** (French amortization system)
- 📈 **Inverted Price Schedules** (Constant Amortization System - SAC)
- 🎯 **Flexible payment scheduling** with irregular due dates
- 📅 **Easy date generation** with smart month-end handling via python-dateutil
- 🔒 **Type-safe interest rates** with explicit percentage handling
- 🧮 **Robust numerics** powered by scipy for IRR and financial calculations
- ⚖️ **Fine engine** with fines, mora interest, and configurable grace periods
- 🍭 **Sugar payment methods** — `pay_installment()` and `anticipate_payment()`
- 📋 **Installments & Settlements** — first-class views of the repayment plan and payment allocation
- 🇧🇷 **Tax module** — Brazilian IOF with pluggable tax strategy, grossup, and preset rates
- 🌐 **Timezone-aware** — all datetimes are UTC by default, configurable globally

## 🧮 Time Value of Money Functions

MoneyWarp provides comprehensive TVM functions powered by scipy:

### Present Value Functions
- **Present Value (PV)**: Discount future cash flows to present value
- **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Sum of discounted cash flows
- **Present Value of Annuities**: Regular payment streams
- **Present Value of Perpetuities**: Infinite payment streams
- **Discount Factors**: Time value calculations

### Internal Rate of Return
- **IRR**: Rate where NPV equals zero (scipy-powered for reliability)
- **Modified IRR (MIRR)**: IRR with different financing/reinvestment rates
- **Day-count conventions**: `YearSize.commercial` (365) or `YearSize.banker` (360) for IRR and MIRR
- **Automatic bracketing**: Robust root finding across complex cash flows
- **Sugar syntax**: `loan.irr()` convenience methods (automatically uses the loan's `year_size`)

### Integration Features
- **Time Machine compatibility**: All functions work with `Warp`
- **High precision**: Maintains decimal precision throughout
- **Type safety**: Full type annotations and mypy compatibility
- **Error handling**: Clear messages and edge case handling

## 🏗️ Architecture

MoneyWarp is built around core financial concepts:

- **💰 Money**: High-precision monetary amounts using Decimal
- **📈 InterestRate**: Type-safe rates with frequency conversions, abbreviated notation, and day-count conventions
- **💸 CashFlow**: Collections with SQLAlchemy-style querying
- **🏦 Loan**: State machines for loan analysis and tracking
- **📋 Installment & Settlement**: Derived views of repayment plans and payment allocations
- **🇧🇷 Tax**: Pluggable tax strategy with IOF, grossup, and presets
- **🌐 tz**: Timezone configuration — UTC default, global `set_tz()`, silent coercion
- **🕰️ Warp**: Time Machine for temporal financial analysis

## 🧪 Quality & Testing

- **830+ comprehensive tests** with 100% core functionality coverage
- **Type safety**: Full mypy compatibility with zero type errors
- **Code quality**: Passes ruff linting and black formatting
- **Robust numerics**: Scipy-powered calculations for reliability
- **Reference validation**: Tested against established financial libraries

MoneyWarp combines the power of modern Python with solid financial theory to provide a reliable foundation for time value of money calculations.
